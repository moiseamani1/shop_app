# Flowerz

I have built a simple flutter demo mobile application(Android/IOS) for listing flowers. This is just a hypothetical client-side to a complete system. 

* Users can add favorites
* Users can post listings of their flowers, edit their listings and view listings
* Users are automatically logged out after a period of time
* Users are automatically logged in during their authenticated session period.(i.e. app closing does not lead to logging in again)
* Users can add flower items to a cart and place orders

The backend of my app is Firebase. I am using Firebases's REST API for authentication and authorisation.
I am also using it to populate and update my database with POST and PATCH requests.
